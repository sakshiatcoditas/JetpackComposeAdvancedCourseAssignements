This repository contains my practice projects from Jetpack Compose for Android Developers, covering key concepts like Compose UI testing, drawing with the Canvas API, building adaptive navigation using WindowSizeClass, and handling side effects (LaunchedEffect, DisposableEffect, SideEffect). Each folder demonstrates a focused implementation to strengthen my understanding of modern Android development with Jetpack Compose.
